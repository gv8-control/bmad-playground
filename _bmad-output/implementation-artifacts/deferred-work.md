# Deferred Work

## Deferred from: code review of 1-1-scaffold-the-platform-monorepo-and-ci-pipeline (2026-06-18)

- `.claude/settings.json` — leading `*` wildcard in `Bash(python3 *_bmad/scripts/*)` removes the path anchor present in the original rule; any path ending in `_bmad/scripts/` is now accepted, widening attack surface beyond the intended `_bmad/` directory.
- `ProvisionParams.repoUrl` and `credential` never passed in tests — all test calls use `{ conversationId } as any`, bypassing type safety. Real integration coverage of these fields deferred to the story that implements the real SandboxService.
- `credential` field flows as a bare string with no format documentation, no logging guard, and no expiry awareness. Mitigate before real credential handling is wired in (Story 1.2 / 3.x range).
- `SandboxInfo.provisionedAt` is typed `?: Date` but no consumer null-guards it. Any idle-timeout or TTL logic that reads this field will silently skip eviction on undefined, producing zombie sandboxes. Fix when idle-timeout logic is implemented.
- `sandboxId: fake-sandbox-${Date.now()}` — two provisions in the same millisecond produce the same ID and silently overwrite in the Map. Low risk at `maxWorkers: 1` but will bite if worker count is raised. Switch to `crypto.randomUUID()` or similar before parallelising tests.
- `overrideProviders` in `test-module-builder.ts` silently drops entries where `useValue` is explicitly `undefined` due to `!== undefined` guard. Fix when a test needs to override a provider to `undefined`.

## Deferred from: re-review of 1-1-scaffold-the-platform-monorepo-and-ci-pipeline (2026-06-18)

- `libs/shared-types/src/sandbox.constants.ts` re-exports `SANDBOX_SERVICE` from `sandbox.interface.ts`, and both are re-exported via `index.ts` — redundant but functional since both traces resolve to the same declaration.
- Nx generator stub files `libs/shared-types/src/lib/shared-types.ts` and `libs/database-schemas/src/lib/database-schemas.ts` are not part of the public API and serve no purpose beyond the auto-generated spec files. Remove when cleaning up generator residue.
- `apps/web/src/app/page.tsx` is the Nx default welcome template rather than a placeholder redirect. Replace when the first real page is implemented.
- Inter and JetBrains Mono fonts are declared in `tailwind.config.ts` theme but never loaded (no `<link>` in layout or `@import` in CSS). Add font loading when the first styled component is built.
- `libs/database-schemas/src/index.ts` imports from `./generated/client` which does not exist on a clean checkout until `prisma generate` runs. The `dependsOn: ["generate"]` on `lint` and `typecheck` targets mitigates this for Nx-driven workflows, but a bare `tsc` or IDE cold-start will show import errors until generate is run.

## Deferred from: code review of 1-3-connect-a-repository-by-url (2026-06-19)

- DEK not zeroed after use in `decryptToken` — the plaintext DEK remains on the heap until GC; standard practice is `dek.fill(0)` in a `finally` block.
- Org-restriction detection via heuristic GitHub API message substring matching — fragile if GitHub changes error message wording. Revisit when a reliable GitHub header is documented.
- `data.permissions` absent or degraded for organization repos accessed via team membership — results in misleading `INSUFFICIENT_PERMISSION` error; documented in Dev Notes #8. Mitigate in Story 1.6 (credential failure recovery).
- `callbackUrl` in `auth.config.ts` set to `pathname` only — query string parameters stripped on auth redirect; no protected pages currently use query params.
- `/api/internal/test/repo-connections/[id]` DELETE has no Prisma P2025 error handling — non-existent ID throws 500, causing misleading test teardown failures.
- `syntheticSession` in `playwright/auth.setup.ts` mints real JWT tokens from `AUTH_SECRET` — if `AUTH_SECRET` leaks from CI, arbitrary sessions can be forged; inherent to synthetic session architecture.

## Deferred from: code review of 1-3-connect-a-repository-by-url (2026-06-20)

- Nonce length not validated in `decryptToken` — `dekNonce`/`tokenNonce` decoded from Base64 without asserting exactly 12 bytes; a corrupt nonce throws an unhelpful native OpenSSL error rather than a descriptive application error.
- `encryptedDek` minimum-size guard too weak — `< TAG_LENGTH` (16-byte) guard passes for exactly 16 bytes, yielding zero-byte ciphertext; a valid DEK ciphertext is at least 48 bytes. Currently caught by outer try/catch.
- Parallel E2E workers share fixed `E2E_GITHUB_ID` — concurrent `withRepoConnection` fixtures mutate the same DB row; teardown from one test can delete another's fixture. Safe with sequential workers.
- No unit test for `decryptToken` failure path in `connectRepository` — a KEK-rotated or tampered credential throws as `UNKNOWN`; no test verifies the catch behavior.
- Middleware permanently exempts `/api/internal/test` from auth — `TEST_ENV` route guard is the sole protection layer; accidental `TEST_ENV=true` in a non-local environment exposes data-mutation endpoints without authentication.

## Deferred from: code review of 1-3-connect-a-repository-by-url (Review 4 — 2026-06-20)

- `encryptToken` in NextAuth jwt callback has no application-level error handling — if `CREDENTIAL_ENCRYPTION_KEK` is misconfigured, `getKek()` throws and NextAuth's internal error handler redirects all sign-in attempts to `/sign-in?error=…`; the root cause (missing env var) is not logged at the catch site. A startup env-var validation or an explicit try/catch with a targeted log is the proper fix. [`apps/web/src/lib/auth.ts:49`]
- Silent repository replacement — `repoConnection.upsert` overwrites an existing connection without user confirmation; guarded by the onboarding redirect in normal flow but reachable via direct navigation. Intentional upsert semantics for MVP; confirmation UI belongs in a future story. [`apps/web/src/actions/repo-connection.actions.ts:126`]
- Internal test routes return 500 on malformed/missing JSON body — `request.json()` has no try/catch in any of the three test API routes; opaque 500 is returned instead of a descriptive error. Test-only risk; the E2E fixture always sends valid JSON. [`apps/web/src/app/api/internal/test/seed-user/route.ts:9`]
- Migration CREATE TABLE has no `IF NOT EXISTS` guard — partial manual pre-creation of `oauth_credentials` or `repo_connections` blocks `prisma migrate deploy` and permanently marks the migration as failed in `_prisma_migrations`. Normal Prisma workflow prevents this via the migration table; idempotency via SQL guards was not added by design. [`libs/database-schemas/src/prisma/migrations/20260619000000_.../migration.sql`]
- GitHub API 429 rate limit treated as generic UNKNOWN — `!response.ok` catch-all returns "unexpected error (429)" with no retry guidance and ignores `Retry-After` header. Rare in current single-user MVP; belongs in a resilience story. [`apps/web/src/actions/repo-connection.actions.ts:109`]

## Deferred from: code review of 1-3-connect-a-repository-by-url (Review 3 — 2026-06-20)

_Edge Case Hunter layer failed (process exited); findings from Blind Hunter and Acceptance Auditor only._

- `withRepoConnection` Playwright fixture only deletes the `RepoConnection` row on teardown — the seeded `User` and its `OAuthCredential` accumulate across test runs; upsert idempotency prevents correctness failures but orphaned credential rows persist in the database.
- `credential_health` TEXT column has no DB-level CHECK constraint — valid values `"healthy"` / `"failed"` enforced only at the TypeScript layer; a typo is silently stored without a constraint violation.
- `CREDENTIAL_ENCRYPTION_KEK` is validated lazily on first call rather than at process startup — spec says "startup guard"; Next.js lazy module loading means misconfiguration surfaces as a user-facing error on the first sign-in rather than a boot failure. Documented as intentional in Dev Notes #10.

## Deferred from: code review of 1-2-sign-in-with-github (2026-06-18)

- No database migration infrastructure — no `prisma/migrations` directory or `migrate` script; schema must be applied manually via `prisma db push`.
- `email` column has no uniqueness constraint or index on the `User` model — same email can appear on multiple rows without constraint.
- `next-auth` beta pinned with `^` range — `^5.0.0-beta.31` allows automatic upgrades to future beta releases with potential breaking changes.
- `active` and `lastActiveAt` fields in the `User` model are never updated by the application — fields exist in schema but have no writer until a future story implements them.
- No unit/integration test coverage for AC-2 session persistence (8h maxAge) — requires E2E test coverage in a future story.
- Non-GitHub provider path not handled — if a second OAuth provider is added, `token.userId` is never set for it and `session.userId` will be absent for those users.
- Prisma singleton never resets on stale DB connection — known limitation of the global singleton pattern in Next.js; mitigate when connection resilience is required.
- Static assets in `/public/` beyond `favicon.ico` not excluded from middleware matcher — theoretical concern; no non-favicon public assets currently exist.

## Deferred from: adversarial review of fix-turbopack-build-root (2026-06-30)

- `next` package is hoisted to workspace root in pnpm workspace — abnormal for pnpm's strict default; investigate `.npmrc`/`pnpm-workspace.yaml` hoisting settings for root cause. The `turbopack.root` config is an escape hatch, not a fix for the underlying workspace config smell.
- `clearValidationCache` is an unauthenticated server action exported from a `'use server'` file — any client can invoke it to flush the global cache (DoS / cache-thrashing vector). Pre-existing; making it `async` in this change cemented its server-action status without addressing the exposure. [`apps/web/src/actions/repository-validation.actions.ts:265`]
- `makeValidationError` has zero direct test coverage — the sole constructor for `ValidationError` had its spread order and parameter type changed in this fix, but no spec verifies the `documentationLink` invariant. [`apps/web/src/actions/repository-validation.actions.ts:138`]
- `invalidateValidationCache` silently no-ops on URL mismatch — if `repoUrl` fails the GitHub regex, the function returns without deleting, throwing, or logging. Current caller passes pre-validated URLs, but future callers get silently stale cache. [`apps/web/src/actions/repository-validation.actions.ts:255`]
- Cache-clearing in tests scoped to one `describe` block, not the whole spec file — `validationCache` is module-level, so any other suite calling `validateRepository` leaks cached results across tests. [`apps/web/src/actions/repository-validation.actions.spec.ts:493`]
- `experimental: {}` is dead config in `next.config.js` — empty object serves no purpose. [`apps/web/next.config.js:7`]
- CommonJS `next.config.js` inconsistent with TS/ESM codebase — file uses `require`/`module.exports` + `//@ts-check` while Next.js 16 supports `next.config.ts`. Migrating would give real type-checking on `turbopack.root` and `path.resolve`. [`apps/web/next.config.js`]

## Deferred from: code review of 1-5-resolve-git-identity-for-commit-attribution (2026-07-01)

- Empty/whitespace `githubLogin` produces invalid fallback [`apps/web/src/lib/git-identity.ts:11,16`] — `githubLogin` is not validated for emptiness before being used as fallback name and noreply email local-part. GitHub guarantees `login` is non-empty from OAuth. Not reachable through normal flows.
- `auth()` outside try/catch — rejection unhandled [`apps/web/src/actions/git-identity.actions.ts:13`] — `auth()` call sits outside the try/catch block; if it rejects (JWT decode failure, misconfigured secret), the error escapes as unhandled rejection. Consistent with all sibling Server Actions (`repo-connection.actions.ts:46`, `repository-validation.actions.ts:281`). Codebase-wide pattern, not a Story 1.5 issue.

## Deferred from: adversarial review of git-identity.test.ts comment fix (2026-07-01)

- Test name/body mismatch, pre-existing [`apps/web/src/lib/git-identity.test.ts:124`] — `'function accepts no token parameter in its signature'` describes a signature check, but the body only asserts on the return value; no signature-level check exists. Predates this comment fix.
- Near-duplicate test coverage, pre-existing [`apps/web/src/lib/git-identity.test.ts:115-137`] — the `'return type contains only name and email keys'` test and the `'function accepts no token parameter'` test both assert the same return shape at runtime. Predates this comment fix.

## Deferred from: code review of 1-6-detect-and-recover-from-credential-failures (2026-07-01)

### FINDING-14: Cache delays credential-failure detection — RESOLVED ✅

- `cacheGet` returns stale success after credential expiry [`apps/web/src/actions/repository-validation.actions.ts:94`] — once a positive validation is cached (120s TTL), subsequent `validateRepository` calls short-circuit before touching GitHub, so a revoked credential is not detected until cache expiry.
- **Resolution:** `validateRepository` now calls `getCredentialHealth(userId)` before returning a cached result. If health is `'failed'`, the cache is bypassed and validation re-fetches from GitHub. The credential health check uses the existing `getCredentialHealth` function from `credential-health.ts`, avoiding a cross-module import from `markCredentialFailed` into the cache layer. Three tests added covering `failed` bypass, `healthy` cache-hit, and `null` (no RepoConnection) cache-hit paths.

### FINDING-13: Re-auth race condition — RESOLVED ✅

- Re-auth `updateMany('healthy')` races with concurrent `markCredentialFailed('failed')` [`apps/web/src/lib/auth.ts:70-72`, `apps/web/src/lib/credential-health.ts:46-55`] — two non-transactional writers to `RepoConnection.credentialHealth` for the same `userId`. An in-flight 401-handling request using the old token can commit `failed` AFTER re-auth commits `healthy`, leaving a valid fresh token marked `failed`.
- **Resolution:** Strengthened the optimistic concurrency guard from `updatedAt: { lte: capturedAt }` to `updatedAt: { lt: capturedAt }` (strict less-than), so a stale `failed` write cannot clobber a `healthy` write even in the same millisecond. The guard already existed — the fix is the strictness improvement `lte` → `lt`.

### Tenant-isolation test is tautological [`apps/web/src/lib/credential-health.test.ts`] — the test asserts the mock was not called with `'usr_other'`, but since the test only invokes `resolveOAuthToken(USER_ID)`, the mock could never have been called with another user's ID. The `expect(callArg).toEqual({ where: { userId: USER_ID } })` assertion is meaningful; the `not.toContain('usr_other')` check is redundant. Implementation is correct (`findUnique({ where: { userId } })`).

### FINDING-12: 403 over-firing marks valid credentials as failed — RESOLVED ✅

- `fetchGithubContents` throws `CredentialFailureError` for ALL 403s, and `connectRepository` calls `markCredentialFailed` on `inspectBmadSetup` 403s. A 403 from org OAuth App restrictions or repo-level permission denials incorrectly marks a valid token as `failed`, causing a re-auth loop. [`apps/web/src/lib/repository-validation.ts:139-146`, `apps/web/src/actions/repo-connection.actions.ts:121-146`]
- **Resolution:** `fetchGithubContents` now only throws `CredentialFailureError` for 401 (genuine bad-creds). Non-rate-limit 403s return `null` (path inaccessible) — the caller treats it like a 404 without marking the credential as failed. In `connectRepository`, the direct-fetch 403 handler no longer calls `markCredentialFailed` after ruling out org-restriction; `INSUFFICIENT_PERMISSION` is returned without marking the credential.

## Deferred from: code review of 1-7-enforce-authenticated-full-access-for-all-mvp-users (2026-07-01)

- `/api/internal/test/*` bypasses auth in production [`apps/web/src/middleware.ts:8`] — matcher permanently exempts `/api/internal/test` from auth; `TEST_ENV` route guard is the sole protection layer. Known issue (deferred-work.md line 35); spec explicitly says DO NOT fix in this story.
- Layout redirect omits `callbackUrl` (unlike middleware) [`apps/web/src/app/(dashboard)/layout.tsx:7`] — `redirect('/sign-in')` in the dashboard layout does not preserve the user's intended destination via `callbackUrl`, unlike the middleware `authorized` callback. Spec-prescribed pattern; existing pages (`page.tsx`, `onboarding/page.tsx`) follow the same convention.
- Matcher regex over-excludes prefix-colliding paths [`apps/web/src/middleware.ts:8`] — negative-lookahead alternatives `api/auth`, `api/internal/test`, `_next/static`, `_next/image` lack trailing boundary anchors; paths like `/api/authors` or `/api/authentication` are silently excluded from auth. Pre-existing in the unchanged matcher; spec says DO NOT modify.
- `auth()` throwing in layout guard is unhandled [`apps/web/src/app/(dashboard)/layout.tsx:5`] — `await auth()` has no try/catch; if `auth()` rejects (corrupt JWT, misconfigured `AUTH_SECRET`), the error propagates uncaught with no `error.tsx` boundary. Codebase-wide pattern; all existing pages and server actions follow the same convention.

## Deferred from: code review of spec-1-4-fix-skills-directory-detection (2026-07-01)

- No test coverage for large `.claude/skills/` fan-out (dozens+ of directory entries) [`apps/web/src/actions/repository-validation.actions.ts:139-156`] — `countSkills` fires one unbounded parallel GitHub request per skill directory (this repo alone has 90+); the spec explicitly rejected adding a concurrency limiter as speculative for MVP repo sizes, so this is an accepted trade-off, not a bug — but there's no test simulating a large-repo fan-out to document expected behavior (or catch a future secondary-rate-limit regression) if that trade-off is revisited.

## Deferred from: code review of 1-8-build-the-persistent-app-shell (2026-07-01)

- Global `*:focus { outline: none }` strips focus indicators from elements without explicit ring [`apps/web/src/app/global.css:9-11`] — every element loses its native focus outline; only elements with individual `focus:ring-*` classes get a visible indicator. Latent today (all interactive elements in the shell carry ring classes), but the first native `<button>`/`<a>`/third-party widget added without a ring class will have no visible focus indicator, violating WCAG 2.4.7. Spec-prescribed pattern (Task 8.1).
- Authenticated user without repo connection stranded on non-onboarding dashboard routes [`apps/web/src/app/(dashboard)/layout.tsx:21`] — layout renders bare `<>{children}</>` when no `RepoConnection` exists; only `/onboarding` redirects connected users away. A user without a repo connection who directly visits `/project-map`, `/artifacts`, `/settings`, or `/conversations/new` gets a chrome-less page with no navigation path to onboarding. Pre-existing behavior (bare render predates this story); redirect logic is out of scope for Story 1.8.
- `repoConnection.findUnique` has no error boundary; DB failure 500s every dashboard route [`apps/web/src/app/(dashboard)/layout.tsx:17`] — `getPrisma().repoConnection.findUnique()` is awaited with no `try/catch` and no `error.tsx` exists in the route tree. A transient DB error or unset `DATABASE_URL` turns every dashboard page into an unhandled 500. Codebase-wide pattern (spec Known Issues says do not fix `auth()` try/catch; same applies here).
- Route-focus effect doesn't recover when `<h1>` mounts after effect runs (async/streamed content) [`apps/web/src/components/shell/AppShell.tsx:19`] — the `useEffect` depends only on `[pathname]` and runs on pathname commit; if a page's `<h1>` is behind a Suspense boundary or streamed from the server, `main.querySelector('h1')` returns `null` at effect time and focus lands on the wrong element. Latent — all current placeholder pages render `<h1>` synchronously. Will surface when streamed content is introduced into the shell.

## Deferred from: code review of 1-4-validate-bmad-initialization-in-the-connected-repository (2026-07-02)

- `validateRepository` is not wired into any UI flow [`apps/web/src/actions/repository-validation.actions.ts`] — the onboarding flow calls `connectRepository`, which invokes `inspectBmadSetup` directly and bypasses the validation cache. `validateRepository` (with its cache) is exercised only by tests. Wiring it into a UI surface (or removing it) is a product decision.
- In-process validation cache is ineffective on multi-instance/serverless deployments [`apps/web/src/actions/repository-validation.actions.ts`] — the `Map` cache and its invalidation only hold within one process. Accepted MVP limitation; revisit if deployment topology changes.
- GitHub contents API truncates directory listings at 1000 entries [`apps/web/src/actions/repository-validation.actions.ts`] — a repo whose root or `.claude/skills/` exceeds 1000 entries could produce a false `MISSING_DIRECTORY`/skills undercount. Exotic for MVP; the git trees API would be the fix.
- Required dirs tracked as submodules/symlinks report as missing [`apps/web/src/actions/repository-validation.actions.ts`] — the `type === 'dir'` filter rejects `submodule`/`symlink` entries even though the directory exists after checkout.
- `config.yaml` version parsed from a `# Version:` comment [`apps/web/src/actions/repository-validation.actions.ts`] — comment-based format is not guaranteed by BMAD; a regeneration that drops the comment silently downgrades detection to the `package.json` fallback. Works against real BMAD 6.x output today.
- ~~Rate-limit 403 still conflated with credential failure~~ **RESOLVED per FINDING-12** [`apps/web/src/lib/repository-validation.ts`] — `detectGithubRateLimit` now classifies rate-limit 403s (primary: `X-RateLimit-Remaining: 0` header; secondary: "secondary rate limit" / "abuse detection" body message) and throws `RateLimitError`, not `CredentialFailureError`. Genuine 403s return `null` (path inaccessible). Neither path calls `markCredentialFailed`. See FINDING-12 above.
- Story 1.4 integration-test checklist (onboarding flow 1.3→1.4→1.5, retry-after-fix e2e) unchecked [`_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/1-4-validate-bmad-initialization-in-the-connected-repository.md`] — component-level coverage only; onboarding e2e specs exist but do not cover the BMAD-validation retry path.

## Deferred from: code review of 1-9-document-and-validate-the-kek-rotation-runbook (2026-07-02)

- No AAD context-binding on envelope encryption [`apps/web/src/lib/crypto.ts`] — neither the DEK wrap nor the token encryption calls `setAAD` with the user/credential identity, so a `{encryptedDek,dekNonce,encryptedToken,tokenNonce}` tuple copied into another user's row decrypts cleanly as that user (ciphertext transplant, exploitable by anyone with DB write access). Real hardening, but binding AAD changes the encrypt/decrypt scheme and would break decryption of all existing Story 1.3 credentials without a migration. Address alongside the post-MVP KMS work.
- No `kekId` / key-version column [`libs/database-schemas` schema + `scripts/rotate-kek.ts`] — the rotation script identifies which KEK wraps a row by trial-decryption, which degrades to guesswork after rollbacks/re-rotations/env drift. A `kekId` written at encrypt time would make rotation/verify/idempotency exact. Story 1.9 explicitly excluded key-versioning as out of scope; natural to add with the KMS migration.
- `scripts/rotate-kek.ts` operational polish [`scripts/rotate-kek.ts`] — (a) `findMany` loads the whole `oauth_credentials` table into memory with no cursor batching (fine at MVP scale, revisit for large tables); (b) DEK plaintext Buffers are not `fill(0)`-zeroed after use (Node zeroing is best-effort only); (c) `retry needed` and `failed` share exit code 1, so automation can't distinguish "loop again" from "stop and investigate". All low severity.

## Deferred from: adversarial review of 1-6-ac1-credential-flip-within-one-cycle (2026-07-02)

- No coverage for the rejecting-`markCredentialFailed` path on the GitHub API 401 branch [`apps/web/src/actions/repo-connection.actions.ts:107`] — `await markCredentialFailed(...)` on line 107 has no `.catch()` (unlike line 75 which uses `.catch()`). If `markCredentialFailed` rejects (DB unreachable), the error propagates to the outer catch and the user sees `errorCode: 'UNKNOWN'` instead of `'NO_CREDENTIAL'`. The test only exercises the happy-path flip. A test locking down the expected `errorCode` when `markCredentialFailed` rejects belongs here but is out of scope for the "within one cycle" timing property this change closes.
